        <p> Although Nike’s Air Max 1 is typically known for its sleek and sporty look, it’s a versatile silhouette — one that also lends itself well to premium lifestyle makeovers. No matter if it’s soft suede, luxe leather, or arresting animal print, the Air Max 1 is up to the task, and the latest high-end take on the classic shoe is a tonal “Triple Anthracite.” The upper — from the mudguard to the throat — is dressed entirely in a butter-soft anthracite suede, while black accents arrive on the nylon tongue, laces, and collar. The midsole continues the tonal trend with more anthracite detailing, and a black heel Air bubble and outsole complete the winter-ready look.</p>
